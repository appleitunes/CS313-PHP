            <h1>An <span class="emphasis">Alien</span> Encounter</h1>
            <img src="dog.jpg">
            <p>There I was, on the top of Mount Everest, looking down at an alien spaceship I found.</p>
            <p>"What is it?" my loyal companion, Rex, asks.</p>
            <p>Rex was an odd-looking person. He always walks on all fours and is covered in hair. I keep him around so I have someone to eat my food and homework.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," I reply. "But it looks like it came from up there."</p>
            <p>I gesture toward the stars.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, both Rex and I hear a loud sound coming from the ship. The door begins to open revealing an alien the size of Danny Devito.</p>
            <p>Hello, there" the alien chimes. "Does anyone know where I can find a McDonalds within walking distance."</p>
            <p>Upon hearing the word "walk", Rex becomes excited. </p>
            <p>"Did you say... 'walk'?" he asks.</p>
            <p>"Yes," the alien replies. "I wish to find a McDonalds within walking distance."</p>
            <p>"You fool!" I exclaim. "You've triggered him! Run!"</p>
            <p>The alien looks confused for just a moment before noticing the look on Rex's face and realizes he is in grave danger. The alien sprints toward the ship with Rex in close pursuit, but arrives just in time to slam the door.</p>
            <p>"Phew," he whispers. "That was a close one. And to think, I just came to Earth to treat myself to some McDonalds."</p>
            <p>With a deafening roar, the door of the alien's spaceship is ripped off its hinges, revealing a dog-shaped silhouette.</p>
            <p>"Did I hear the word 'treat'?"</p>
